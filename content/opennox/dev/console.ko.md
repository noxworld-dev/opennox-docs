## Enabling all commands

By default, Nox and OpenNox start with most commands disabled. This is done to prevent cheating in campaign.
Most commands will not work in multiplayer, unless you are a server admin/host.

To enable all commands, open the console (`F1` by default) and type:

```
racoiaws
```

## Remote console

OpenNox does not support original RCON protocol.

Instead, it implements remote console via a builtin SSH server.

## List commands

To get a list of all available commands, use `help`.

Here's the list of the most interesting ones.

For example, to replicate `cheat spawn RedApple` with LUA:

In the console, each line must start with `lua` command:

```lua

```

Notice that variables defined in one `lua` commands can be used in other ones.

It's also possible to write a multi-line command in a single line:

```lua
apple = Nox.ObjectType("RedApple"); p = Nox.Players.host; apple:Create(p)
