The simplest way to host a game is by using OpenNox game client.

Run OpenNox or OpenNox HD, go to the "Network" page, and host the game. Simple as that!

OpenNox will automatically register the game online (for both OpenNox and Nox Reloaded).

It will also attempt to automatically forward ports for the server (using UPnP on your router).

Servers hosted with OpenNox HD version will _not_ allow non-HD clients!

This is done for fairness reasons. Since not everyone runs OpenNox in HD,
it will significantly limit their vision distance, giving a big advantage to HD players.
