The simplest way to host Nox game is via OpenNox game client.

Run OpenNox or OpenNoxHD, go to "Network", and host the game. Simple as that!

OpenNox will automatically register the game online (for both OpenNox and Nox Reloaded).

It will also attempt to automatically open ports for the game (via UPnP on your router).

Servers hosted with OpenNoxHD version will _not_ allow non-HD clients!

This is done for fairness reasons. Since not everyone runs OpenNox in HD,
it will significantly limit their vision distance, giving too much advantage to HD players.
