Vanilla Nox stores game balance values in an encoded `gamedata.bin` file.

OpenNox allows overriding values specified in that file with the ones written in a text-based `gamedata.yml` file.

To try it out, copy [gamedata.yml](./gamedata.yml) to the Nox game directory (not OpenNox directory!).
After this, you can edit it using any text editor (([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) on Windows is recommended).
