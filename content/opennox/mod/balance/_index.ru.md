Vanilla Nox stores game balance values in an encoded `gamedata.bin` file.

OpenNox additionally allows overriding values in that file with the ones written in a text-based `gamedata.yml` file.

To try it out, copy [gamedata.yml](./gamedata.yml) to Nox game directory (not OpenNox directory!).
After this, you can edit it via any text editor (Notepad++ on Windows is advised).
